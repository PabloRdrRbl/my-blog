This is my blog content, written in Markdown, using Pelican Static Site Generator (powered by Python).

This repo hauses the configuration files used to run Pelican and generate the static HTML. For more information on how I set up my blog using GitHub Pages and Pelican, see this blog post (Spanish).

The static HTML generated by Pelican is contained in my [**pablordrrbl.github.io**](https://github.com/PabloRdrRbl/pablordrrbl.github.io) repo and show at [**pablorrobles.com**](pablorrobles.com).
