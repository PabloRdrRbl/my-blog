This is my blog content, written in Markdown, using Pelican Static Site Generator (powered by Python).

For more information on how I set up my website using GitHub Pages and Pelican, see this blog post (Spanish).

The static HTML generated by Pelican is contained in my pablordrrbl.github.io repo and show at http://pablorrobles.com.
